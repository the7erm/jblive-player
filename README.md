jblive-player
=============

Quick &amp; Dirty jblive stream player.

This is a forked version of `player.py` from [fmp](https://github.com/the7erm/fmp-pg)

The Jupiter Broadcasting logo belongs to Jupiter Broadcasting. (I don't own the 
rights, and it's NOT being released under the GPL 3.)  This is not an official
Jupiter Broadcasting app.  Just something I wrote when Iw as board one day.

```pip2 install -r requirements.txt```

You'll also need to have all the right gstreamer plugins installed.

Window Hotkeys:
`F` - Full Screen
`D` - Toggle window decoration
`P`, `A`, `space`, `enter`, `Click the video window` - Stop streaming
